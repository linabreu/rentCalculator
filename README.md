Program utilizes a 2D array to hold rent prices for an apartment complex

How It Works:

This program uses a 2D array to hold rent prices for a fictitous apartment complex. A method is passed to the array to load rent values into the array. The lowest rent apartment is a ground floor, studio apartment which costs $700/month. With each additional bedroom, rent increases by $150/month. With each additional floor, rent increases by $50/month.

The program prompts the user for the number of bedrooms ( 0 for studio - 3) and the floor (0 for ground -5). After validating the input, the program displays the price for the apartment in question and the price for all of the other options offered by the complex.
